            Hey there! I'm Jesus, a back-end developer with a focus on the web.
            To me, bringing a project to life with code is like performing
            magic, especially when it comes to a platform as close to people as
            the web.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not coding, I dive into the world of video games, get lost
            in the lyrics of Imagine Dragons â€“ their music always sets the
            perfect mood for me, and escape to fictional worlds full of
            adventure, magic, and drama in books. And let's not forget about
            Undertale â€“ a game that's not just about pixelated graphics, but
            also about heartwarming characters and unexpected life lessons.
        </p>
        <p>
            I always strive to spread positive energy and create a friendly
            atmosphere where everyone can feel motivated and comfortable. My
            mission is to build a space where we can come together to achieve
            goals as a team, never forgetting to enjoy the journey along the
            way. Because hard work doesn't have to be boring!
        </p>
        <p>
            And don't worry, I've never executed a <strong>"delete from"</strong
            > without the <strong>"where"</strong> clause. ðŸ˜‰
